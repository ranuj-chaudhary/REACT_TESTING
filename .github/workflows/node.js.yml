# Node.js Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow
# This workflow performs a clean installation of node dependencies,
# caches/restores them, builds the source code, and runs tests across
# different Node.js versions to ensure compatibility.

# Workflow Name
name: Node.js CI

# Trigger Conditions
on:
  # # Run the workflow on pushes to the "main" branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]
  # Run the workflow on pull requests targeting the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

# Job Definitions
jobs:
  # Main job named "build"
  build:
    # Define the operating system used for the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Matrix Strategy
    strategy:
      # Run the job across multiple Node.js versions
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x] # Testing on Node.js versions 18, 20, and 22
        # Reference for supported Node.js versions: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

    # Workflow Steps
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the Repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # Uses the GitHub Action for checking out the code repository

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        # Uses the GitHub Action to set up the specified Node.js version
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }} # Specifies the Node.js version from the matrix
          cache: "npm" # Enables caching for npm dependencies

      # Step 3: Install Dependencies
      - run: |
          cd react_testing_jest
          npm ci

      - run: npm run test
